Code	Title	Description
999	Errors not specifically identified	This code is used to identify errors that have not been specifically addressed in the Reason code list. It can be used at any level and refers to the level for which it has been identified.
A01	Message fully accepted	The message has been fully accepted for application processing.
A02	Message fully rejected	N  o part of the message has been accepted for application processing, e.g. Global position incomplete.
A03	Message contains errors at the time series level	Part of the message contents, i.e. certain time series, has been accepted for application processing. It is necessary to look at the time series level to determine the time series that have been rejected. The time series is excluded from the global position.
A04	Time interval incorrect	T he schedule time interval is not within the contractual agreement or the period does not agree with the schedule time interval.
A05	Sender without valid contract	The sender has no current valid contract with the TSO. The message consequently will be fully rejected.
A06	Schedule accepted	The schedule of the recipient as presented has been completely accepted.
A07	Schedule partially accepted	The schedule of the recipient as presented has been partially accepted. It is necessary to look at the time series level to determine the changes (time series rejected, modified, etc.).
A08	Schedule rejected	The schedule of the recipient as presented has been totally rejected. The cause could be the non presentation of a counter part for the involved trades.
A09	Time series not matching	Time series mismatches.
A10	Credit limit exceeded	The contractual credit limit has been exceeded and as such the message has been rejected.
A20	Time series fully rejected	The time series has been fully rejected. In the case of a confirmation report, this reason code is used in conjunction with either A26 or A30.
A21	Time series accepted with specific time interval errors	The time series has been accepted but some time interval quantities have been rectified or zeroed out.
A22	In party/Out party invalid	There is no contract for the parties indicated or the rules for cross border nominations are not being respected. The time series has been rejected.
A23	Area invalid	The area is unknown or not allowed. The time series has been rejected.
A24	A24 not applicable	This code is no longer applicable.
A25	A25 not applicable	This code is no longer applicable.
A26	Default time series applied	The time series has been rejected and replaced with a default time series profile. This reason code may not be used in conjunction with A30.
A27	Cross border capacity exceeded	The cross border capacity has been exceeded. The time series has been rejected or adjusted.
A28	Counterpart time series missing	This provides an indication that the time series has not got a counterpart time series.  In the case of an Intermediate Confirmation Report this is advising the recipient that the time series may be rejected at nomination closure if the counterpart time series is not received.  In the case of a Final Confirmation Report this is informing the recipient that the time series has been rejected because the counterpart time series has not been forthcoming.
A29	Counterpart time series quantity differences	The time series has been rejected as it does not match that of the counterpart who is considered by market rules to be correct.
A30	Imposed Time series from nominated party's time series (party identified in reason text)	The nominated party's time series has replaced the current time series. This reason code may not be used in conjunction with A26.
A41	Resolution inconsistency	The resolution is not coherent with the time interval, or resolution not valid.
A42	Quantity inconsistency	The quantity is not coherent. For example a time period with the same version number but different quantities or an non permitted number of digits after the decimal point, etc.
A43	Quantity increased	The quantity has been increased in order to satisfy minimum constraints.
A44	Quantity decreased	The quantity has been decreased in order to satisfy congestion constraints.
A45	Default quantity applied	The default quantity has been applied as the current quantity does not satisfy contractual obligations.
A46	Quantities must not be signed values	The quantity proposed is illegal since signed values are only permitted in specific circumstances.

A49	Position inconsistency	A position is missing or too many.
A50	Senders time series version conflict	There is an error in the sender time series version, i.e. it could be superior to the message version or is inconsistent with the existing data. The time series has been rejected.
A51	Message identification or version conflict	The message identification is already in the receiving system. Or a higher version already exists. Message rejected.
A52	Time series missing from new version of message	A time series is not contained in a new version of the message. Message rejected.
A53	Receiving party incorrect	The receiving party is incorrect. Message rejected.
A54	Global position not in balance	The message does not balance out to zero. Market rules might require that the message is rejected.
