CODE	DEFINITION	DESCRIPTION
MWH	Mega watt hours	The total amount of bulk energy transferred or consumed.
MAW	Mega watt	A unit of bulk power flow, which can be defined as the rate of energy transfer /consumption when a current of 1000 amperes flows due to a potential of 1000 volts at unity power factor expressed in millions of a watt
MAH	Mega volt ampere reactive hours	Total amount of reactive power across a power system.
MAR	Mega volt ampere reactive	A unit of electrical reactive power represented by a current of one thousand amperes flowing due to a potential difference of one thousand volts where the sine of the phase angle between them is 1.
KWT	kilo watt	A unit of bulk power flow, which can be defined as the rate of energy transfer /consumption when a current of 1000 amperes flows due to a potential of 1000 volts at unity power factor expressed in thousands of a watt
KWH	kilo watt hour	A total amount of electrical energy transferred or consumed in one hour
